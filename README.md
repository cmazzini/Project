**Modeling the Insurance & Flood Mitigation Value of Native Landscaping in Houston**

---

## 📍 Overview
Native landscaping offers a low-cost, decentralized strategy to mitigate flooding in urban areas. This project leverages geospatial and insurance data to model how native vegetation can reduce flood risk in Houston, TX. We aim to identify high-ROI planting zones, evaluate cost-saving potential, and deliver tools that support smarter insurance, public policy, and community action.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Quantify the relationship between native vegetation and reduced flood risk
- Model insurance claim reduction potential from native landscaping
- Estimate public ROI of landscaping incentive programs
- Deliver geospatial tools and actionable insights for stakeholders

## ❓ Key Research Questions
1. Does native landscaping correlate with reduced flood insurance claims?
2. Where are the highest-ROI areas in Houston for implementing native landscaping?
3. How could public or private incentives (e.g., rebates, insurance discounts) reduce flood losses?

## 🗂️ Data Sources (Planned)
- FEMA National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Claims Data
- Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) & City of Houston GIS
- National Land Cover Database (NLCD), Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
- NOAA Rainfall/Runoff Data
- USGS Elevation & NRCS Soil Drainage Data
- Parcel-level zoning, land use, and local incentive program records

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- **Geospatial Processing:** QGIS, GeoPandas, Rasterio, PostGIS
- **Analysis & Modeling:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, shapely)
- **Visualization:** Folium, Streamlit, Dash, Kepler.gl
- **Notebook & Version Control:** Jupyter, Git, GitHub

## 🔁 Workflow
1. Data acquisition and cleaning (claims, parcels, vegetation, topography)
2. Feature extraction: vegetation cover, soil, slope, proximity to floodplain
3. Exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis
4. Predictive modeling: flood claim likelihood and claim cost
5. ROI analysis for public/private incentive structures
6. Deliverables: dashboards, maps, briefs, outreach materials

## 🎓 For Collaborators
This project welcomes input from:
- GIS specialists (spatial joins, vegetation classification, raster analysis)
- Native plant experts (species selection for hydrology impact)
- Civic planners, flood control professionals, and policy designers

## 📈 Deliverables
- Interactive map/dashboard of target zones for native planting
- Predictive model of flood risk & vegetation effectiveness
- ROI calculator for program design
- CRS policy alignment brief (FEMA credit potential)
- Public messaging toolkit for program outreach

## 🚀 Future Extensions
- Pilot native landscaping incentives in high-risk communities
- Survey residents to assess adoption barriers
- Model impact on urban heat islands and biodiversity
- Apply methodology to support affordable housing resilience planning
